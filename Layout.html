                <h3>Targeted Plasticity Therapy using Vagus Nerve Stimulation</h3>
                <p>
                    Neuroplasticity – or brain plasticity – is the brain’s ability to adjust its connections or “rewire” itself based on experiences. Without this ability to change, humans would be unable to learn new information or recover from brain injuries. Plasticity is critically involved in all forms of learning including recovery of function after injury.

                <p>
                    Exciting events can enhance plasticity and accelerate learning. During these events the rush of adrenaline activates a nerve in the neck known as the vagus nerve. When the vagus nerve is activated it releases chemicals in the brain which enhances learning. Electrically activating the vagus nerve has been shown to enhance learning and recovery following a brain injury.

                    Researchers at the Texas Biomedical Device Center have developed a therapy to help brain injury patients fully reengage in life. Targeted Plasticity Therapy (TPT) uses brain plasticity to “rewire” neural pathways around the injured parts of the brain. TPT allows people to recover motor, sensory and cognitive functions.

                <strong>The History of Neuroplasticity </strong>
                    <p>
                           
                        For much of our medical history, doctors and scientists believed that our brains remain largely unchanged after infancy. In 1977, a paper was published declaring that neuroplasticity, plasticity of the brain and neural pathways, was possible in youths. By 1991, researchers began to understand that adult brains and neurological systems were also capable of change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            By the end of the century, scientists determined that direct brain stimulation could be utilized to affect neural plasticity, and the early 2000’s saw scientists begin to define parameters associated with targeted neuroplasticity.
